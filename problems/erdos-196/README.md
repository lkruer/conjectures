## Problem and manuscript claim

The problem asks whether every permutation of the natural numbers contains an increasing or decreasing four-term arithmetic progression as a subsequence.

The manuscript claims a bijection $p:\mathbb{N}_0\to\mathbb{N}_0$ with no indices $i<j<k<\ell$ satisfying both $p(i)+p(k)=2p(j)$ and $p(j)+p(\ell)=2p(k)$.

This description follows the supplied manuscript. Its mathematical correctness and correspondence to the current official problem have not been independently reviewed in this repository.

## Scope and reading guide

The claimed permutation enumerates all natural numbers and avoids both directions of monotone four-term progressions. The supplied Lean file is the body intended for the counterexample task wrapper.

Theorem 1.1 states the result. Sections 2–5 develop the finite extension argument, Section 6 builds the permutation, and Section 7 discusses formalization and reproducibility.

## Formalization

`target` for the negation of `Erdos196.erdos_196`.
