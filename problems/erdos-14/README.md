## Problem and manuscript claim

For $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}_0$, let $E_A(N)$ count positive integers at most $N$ without exactly one unordered representation as a sum of two elements of $A$, allowing equal summands. Part I asks whether $N^{1/2-\varepsilon}=O(E_A(N))$ for every $A$ and every $\varepsilon>0$. Part II asks whether some $A$ has $E_A(N)=o(\sqrt{N})$.

The manuscript claims the uniform bound $\sqrt{N}<12000 E_A(N)$ for every $A$ and every integer $N\geq 2\cdot 10^{24}$. It uses this to answer part I affirmatively and part II negatively.

This description follows the supplied manuscript. Its mathematical correctness and correspondence to the current official problem have not been independently reviewed in this repository.

## Scope and reading guide

Both parts are covered by the unified PDF. The two supplied Lean files have separate final targets and duplicate the shared core; they should be checked separately in their respective task wrappers.

Theorem 1.1 gives the uniform bound; Corollaries 1.2 and 1.3 state the two answers. Sections 2–6 contain the argument, and Section 7 describes the supplied formalizations and the scope of previously reported checks.

## Formalization

`target` for `Erdos14.erdos_14.parts.i`; a separate `target` for the negation of `Erdos14.erdos_14.parts.ii`.

See the [Lean record](lean/README.md) for the uploaded files, reported environment, and missing reproduction materials. Previously reported checks in the manuscript are recorded separately from checks performed in this repository.
